# Train AI bot to play Flappy Bird

In this project, I have re-created the simple single player game Flappy bird from scratch. In the original game the main aim is to pass as many pipes as possible by jumping/flying the bird. 

The user tries to understand the dynamics by trial to see how large the birds jump and how fast it drops if stopped flapping.
