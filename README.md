# Train AI bot to play Flappy Bird

In this project, I have re-created the simple single player game Flappy bird from scratch. In the original game the main aim is to pass as many pipes as possible by jumping/flying the bird. 

The user tries to understand the dynamics by trial to see how large the birds jump and how fast it drops if stopped flapping. In this project, instead of user input, I utilized NEAT package to create many birds to learn the dynamics of the game with genetic algorithm, where each genetic iteration the bird reaches farther.
